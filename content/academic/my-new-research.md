# 📝 A Humanitarian Call for Academic "Co-Authorship"

### **Current Research Status:** *Phenomenally unpublished.* ### **The Proposition:**
In light of my currently pristine (and tragically empty) academic record, I am officially opening applications for **"Visionary Philanthropists"** who wish to perform an act of supreme scholarly charity. 

If you find yourself burdened with an excess of brilliance and a spare slot in your author list, I humbly offer my name for your next publication. 

**What I offer in return:**
* Eternal gratitude (non-expiring).
* A statistically significant increase in the "Coolness Factor" of your paper.
* I promise not to dispute the Nobel Prize when you win it.

### **Mandatory Protocol:**
Should you decide to include me in your scholarly masterpiece, please notify me immediately so I can prepare my "shocked and humbled" social media post.

**Reach out at:**
📧 [hejialejerry@outlook.com](mailto:hejialejerry@outlook.com)
